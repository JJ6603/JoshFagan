        <p class="subtitle">Website and Application Design</p>
        <p>FututresX is an Education Startup company that aims to redefine how education is delivered to students in
            years 7-10 across Australia. <br>
            FuturesX is part of a new wave of LMS based education, focusing on linking skills students learn in school
            with real life applications and industries.</p>
        <p class="lowerpara">As part of my work with FuturesX I conducted research into education and classroom
            engagement, and brainstormed how this could be incorperated into the Website.<br>
            I also created several design sketeches for potential web page layouts, which were then used to create low,
            medium and high fidelity prototypes <br>
            using pen and paper, Figma, and Marvel App.</p>

        <h2 class="workspage">QUT Wellbeing App</h2>
        <p class="subtitle">App Re-Design</p>
        <p>The QUT Wellbeing app was developed as a way for students to better manage their studies and also look after
            their mental health. <br>
            The app is free for all QUT students and consists of a daily planner, meditaion videos, and other content
            related to mental health <br>
            as well as a boking feature for the QUT councelling service</p>
        <p class="lowerpara">My work with the QUT Wellbeing App included interviewing 3 students and asking them to keep
            a diary as they used the app in their day to day lives. <br>
            this helped me to identify several issues with the usability of the app and the overall user experience.
            <br>
            As a result of this I created several low fidelity prototype sketches of potential improvements for the app.

        <h2 class="workspage">Study Eyes</h2>
        <p>HCI Research Project</p>
        <p>As part of my final year of university, I was given a research project in the area of Students Experience
            with procrastination. <br>
            This research involved getting hands on experience with emerging technologies such as AI, Humanoid Robots,
            Augmented Reality and IoT. <br>
            It also involved interviewing and setting up observation sessions with 5 research participants in order to
            better understand study and procrastination habits. <br>
            Using this data I formed a Field Theory around procrastination, and then designed a fictional product aimed
            at highlighting the issues surrounding procrastination.</p>
        <p class="lowerpara">That solution was Study Eyes, a pair of augmented reality glasses that would highlight
            potential distractions in the User's surroundings, <br>
            and can create a persons ideal study environment (library, classroom, or home study) around them in order to
            minimise procrastination. <br>
            I then had to evaluate this product with another 3 research participants which included using several
            interview techniques and another 5-day observation diary.</p>
